# hello-world
My first test repository. Trying to move fast to my actual first project but the basics are important.



I have experienced a lot of frustration in the last year or two over exchanging spreadsheets, documents, etc. I want to become an expert at Git so that I can go work on a team that compiles using this amazing piece of tech.

Today | Do I like Git?
